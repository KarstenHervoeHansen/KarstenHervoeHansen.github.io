      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">DK-Technologies has changed</h1>
      <p>March 2018. The world is changing and DK-Technologies together with DK-Audio has changed too so the brands we have protected over almost
         31 years will survive to the benefit of our loyal customers.
         However, we have been forced to say goodbye to a lot of legacy products and concentrate
         on software development and sales for the never families like the DK1 to 5 range and the DKT7.
         Upon strong interest from customers support of the popular MSD600M++ family could be included.
         All legacy product documentation and software will be available on this site over time based on volunteer work
         so donations for this work are highly appreciated. The best regards Karsten Hansen</p>
